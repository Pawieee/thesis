class tDCBAM(nn.Module):
    """
    A basic Triplet Siamese Similarity Network structure.

    This class wraps the feature extractor and provides a convenient forward
    method that takes anchor, positive, and negative inputs simultaneously,
    primarily used during the pre-training phase with standard Triplet Loss.

    In the meta-learning phase, the feature_extractor is used directly,
    and the metric generation is handled separately by the MetricGenerator.
